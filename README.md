# 📇 Phonebook

**Phonebook** is a web application built with Angular that simulates a phonebook, with features for registering, editing, deleting, searching, and offline persistence of contacts.

Developed with a focus on organization and reactivity, the project uses practices such as BEM in SCSS, Reactive Forms in Angular, and state management with RxJS — ensuring a fluid and responsive experience for the user.
